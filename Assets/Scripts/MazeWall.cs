/*
Here's what each line of the code does:

using UnityEngine; - this line includes the Unity engine library so we can use its classes and functions.

public class MazeGenerator : MonoBehaviour - this line defines the MazeGenerator script as a public class that inherits from the MonoBehaviour class.

public GameObject wallPrefab; - this line creates a public variable that will store the cube wall prefab. We will assign this variable in the Unity editor later.

public int mazeSize = 15; - this line creates a public variable to store the size of the maze. We set it to 15 by default, but we can change it in the Unity editor as well.

void Start() - this line defines the Start() function, which will be called when the script starts running.


for (int i = 0; i < mazeSize; i++) - this line creates a for loop that will iterate over the rows of the maze.

for (int j = 0; j < mazeSize; j++) - this line creates a nested for loop that will iterate over the columns of the maze.

GameObject newWall = Instantiate(wallPrefab, new Vector3(i, 0, j), Quaternion.identity); - this line instantiates a new wall prefab at the current position (i, 0, j) using the Instantiate() function. 
We store the new wall in a variable called newWall.

newWall.transform.parent = transform; - this line sets the parent of the new wall to the MazeGenerator game object. 
This will make the walls children of the MazeGenerator object in the Unity hierarchy.

To use this script, you need to attach it to an empty game object in your Unity scene, and then assign the wall prefab to the wallPrefab variable in the inspector. 
When you run the game, the script will create a 15x15 maze by instantiating the cube wall prefab at each position in a grid.
